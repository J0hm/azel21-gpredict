 TROUBLESHOOTING:

1. Run as root.

2. Make sure rot_split.py and start_rotor.sh have the correct paths 
   at the top, are in the same folder, and have execute permissions.

3. Ensure you are connected to the correct devices. The device is the 
   argument after the "-r" option in start_rotor.sh.

4. If you are getting the "RPRT -6" error when sending the "p" command, try
   using a different port. Edit the port # in both start_rotor.sh and 
   rot_split.py

5. Ensure system has Python 2 and Hamlib 3.0 installed.

6. Test connections to devices with 
    $ sudo rotctl -m 405 -r [DEVICE] -vvvvv
