 TROUBLESHOOTING:

1. Run as root.

2. Make sure rot_split.py and start_rotor.sh have the correct paths 
   at the top, are in the same folder, and have execute permissions.

3. Ensure system has Python 2 and Hamlib 3.0 installed.

4. Ensure you are connected to the correct devices. The device is the 
   argument after the "-r" option in start_rotor.sh. Use devFinder.sh
   to find the correct devices.

5. If you are getting the "RPRT -6" error when sending the "p" command, try
   using a different port. Edit the port # in both start_rotor.sh and 
   rot_split.py

6. If you are getting "[Errno 98] Address already in use" (or other unknown
   errors), a Python instance is still running. Use the following command to 
   find the PID.
    $ ps aux | grep python
   Then use the following command to kill the process.
    $ sudo kill [PID]
   Or, to kill all python processes, use the following command.
    $ sudo pkill python

7. Test connections to devices with 
    $ sudo rotctl -m 405 -r [DEVICE]
