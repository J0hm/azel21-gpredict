INSTRUCTIONS: 

1. Change device number (number after -r argument of rotctld) to the port 
   numbers of the connect azimuth and elevation controllers. The deviceFinder
   script can help you find these numbers.

2. Run start_rotor.sh as root. You do not run manually rotctld or rot_split.py.
   Make sure both scripts have execute permissions.
    $ chmod u+x start_rotor.sh rot_split.py 
    $ sudo ./start_rotor.sh

3. Under "Antenna Control" in Gpredict engage on a rotator device with 
   the proper az/el settings and port 4533.

4. To stop the script, CTRL-C.
